##About Myself

Read, write and speak fluently in English and Japanese after I spend 12 years living in the United States.

Studied Mechanical Engineering in Idaho, then moved to Silicon Valley to help
in-vehicle car navigation systems development between the United States
and Japan.

In the last days in SV, I started a company with 7 of my friends, WorkSpot,
which enabled VPS-like services in year of 2000 using VNC technology,
as well as developed software for wireless Palm.

Currently, my focus is on development using PHP and RDB system for various web-sites.
