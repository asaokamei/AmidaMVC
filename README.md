AmidaMVC
========

Yet another MVC Framework for PHP, based on amida-style dispatch chain.

I developed this framework for studying and some demo purpose.

Amida-Chain
-----------

Started as Chain of Responsibility implementation, it quickly became
a class/method dispatcher looked like a Japanese traditional Amida-Kuji.

Usage
-----

Seriously, how I can write a usage for a framework?
Except to provide some demo and ask to look at the code...
