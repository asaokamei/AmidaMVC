AmidaMVC
========

Yet another MVC Framework for PHP, based on amida-style dispatch chain.  
I developed this framework for studying and some demo purpose.

View Source Codes

    source code of AmidaMVC Framework.

*   [vendor](vendor/README.md):

    Currently, PHPMarkdown is used.

*   tests:  
    going to contain some tests. almost empty now. 

*   _Config:   
    configuration for viewin this source as a demo site.



Amida-Chain
-----------

Started as Chain of Responsibility implementation, it quickly became
a class/method dispatcher looked like a Japanese traditional Amida-Kuji.

Usage
-----

Seriously, how I can write a usage for a framework?
Except to provide some demo and ask to look at the code...
