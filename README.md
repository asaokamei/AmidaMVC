AmidaMVC
========

Yet another MVC Framework for PHP, based on amida-style dispatch chain.

I developed this framework for studying and some demo purpose.

Source Code Viewing in AmidaMVC
-------------------

*   [src/AmidaMVC](src/AmidaMVC/README.md):  
    source code of AmidaMVC Framework.

*   [vendor](vendor):  
    includes external library used in the Framework.
    Currently, PHPMarkdown is used.

*   _Config:

Amida-Chain
-----------

Started as Chain of Responsibility implementation, it quickly became
a class/method dispatcher looked like a Japanese traditional Amida-Kuji.

Usage
-----

Seriously, how I can write a usage for a framework?
Except to provide some demo and ask to look at the code...
